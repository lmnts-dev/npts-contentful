It’s Spring time, and trees are blooming. It’s time to assess how they did over the winter and make a plan for the coming growing season. While Spring is not the ideal time to prune some trees, many do well and can be addressed. Here is a link to a blog post by Davey Tree, one of the industry leaders in tree care, about pruning in the Spring. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.davey.com/2017/04/pruning-trees-in-spring-is-it-ok-to-do/\">Pruning Trees</a></p>\n<p>Luckily, because of our dry climate, many tree diseases are less common, but if you have any trees that you’re considering pruning or trimming, or have a tree removal that you’re unsure about, please contact us. We are happy to come out and assess the tree and give a recommendation. </p>\n<p>Thanks, from Noah’s Park Tree Care.</p>","excerpt":"Greetings all! It’s Spring time, and trees are blooming.
