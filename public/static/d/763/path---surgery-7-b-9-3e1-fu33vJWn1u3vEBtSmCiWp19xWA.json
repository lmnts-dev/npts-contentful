Cables generally consist of extra high-strength steel and are attached to bolts installed in the upper crown of a tree. They are intended to limit the movement of the supported branches so they are less likely to fail during storms. Braces are thread rod that are installed through unions of weak branches and multiple stems to provide more rigid support from torsional (twisting) forces that can occur in violent weather. Noah’s Park staff are well versed in the cabling and bracing procedures that are the current industry standards.</p>\n<p>Supplemental structural support systems should only be installed based on a thorough inspection and evaluation of tree structure by our certified arborists. Materials and techniques must comply with published industry standards (American National Standards Institute A-300 Standards).</p>","excerpt":"Cables and brace rods are supplemental structural supports intended to reduce the risk of failure of weak branches and multiple stems.
